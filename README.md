# TRAVL-Buddy-System
TRAV.L is a website that connects students to a safe travel buddy system when traveling.

# Inspiration
We were inspired by campus safety issues as women attending university next month. While tackling the “education” theme in this hackathon, we realized that education comes only when safety is guaranteed. We believe that while a safe environment should be provided in education centers, it may not always be the case. That is why we’ve created TRAV.L, which will greatly aid students when walking to and from campus.

# What it does
After creating an account, users can easily enter into travel rooms which match their schedule and preferences. Users also have the option to create their own travel room through filling out the necessary information. To ensure safe communication and travels, each room will uniquely generate a code which will only be available to users after joining the room.

# How we built it
We build this website in 2 days from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additional frameworks have been used such as Bootstrap, and Firebase for our user database.

# Challenges we ran into
We were all beginner hackers and programmers when this hackathon started, and we all learnt a lot from workshops as well as our own research. Small things like not linking the script was slowing down our debugging process, but now we feel more comfortable coding.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning FireBase and using Bootstrap for the first time!

# What's next for TRAV.L
As a safety-promoting website, TRAV.L will continue updating our page and creating new ways to help students securely travel!
